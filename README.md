# 👋 Hi, I'm Julie Jane

Junior software developer based in Switzerland 🇨🇭  
Curious, detail-oriented, and learning step by step — by building.

## 🧩 What you’ll find here
A collection of school modules, exercises, and small projects where I practice:
- **Java** (modules, exercises, small projects)
- **JavaScript** (module projects and experiments)
- **HTML / CSS** (static pages and UI practice)
- **PHP** (mini forum project)
- **React Native** (learning & small app experiments)

## 📌 Featured repos
- **Modulo183** — *Mini forum* (PHP)
- **GiocoQuiz** — quiz game (Java)
- **Modulo320 / Java** — exercises and module work
- **Progetto_modulo_322** — JavaScript (React-native) project
- **demoAppReact** — JS / React practice
- **lumina-creative** — HTML project
- **foxlab** — CSS practice

## 🌱 Currently
- Improving consistency on personal projects  
- Strengthening fundamentals (structure, clarity, clean code)  
- Turning what I learn at work and school into public mini-projects  

## ✨ About me
I like learning deeply (not fast),  
and I care about clarity — in code and in communication.
